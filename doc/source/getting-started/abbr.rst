Glossary of abbreviations
=========================

Like all technical documentation, the documentation for PyAnsys libraries
includes lots of abbreviations, which is a general term that also includes
acronyms and initialisms.

On the first use of an abbreviation that might be unfamiliar to the developer
community, the documentation for a PyAnsys library provides the longer word
or phrase. For your convenience, this page provides a glossary of all these
abbreviations.

used to interact with the Ansys Mechanical solver. See also MAPDL, an FEA (finite

to communicate with each other. An API is a type of software interface,
offering a service to other pieces of software.

**BC**

Boundary condition: A place on a structure where either the external force or
the displacement is known at the start of the analysis. In this way, BCs (boundary
conditions) are where the structure interacts with the environment either through
the application of an external force or through some restraint that is imposing
a displacement. See also DOF.

**CAD**

turbomachinery, include pumps, turbines, compressors, fans, and other rotating
machinery.

amounts of data. Deep learning is what drives many AI (artificial intelligence)
technologies.

**DNS**

Domain name system: A hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers,
services, and other resources on the internet or other IP (internet protocol) networks.
Just like a telephone directory translates names to phone numbers, DNS translates domain names
to IP addresses, which are numerical labels assigned to every device connected
to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

**DOF**

Degrees of freedom: The minimum number of independent parameters that are required
to define the position of a rigid body in space. BCs (boundary conditions) are
typically expressed in terms of applicable degrees of freedom.

**DPF**

and engineers with a toolbox for accessing and transforming simulation data. With DPF,
you can perform complex preprocessing or postprocessing of large amounts of simulation
data within a simulation workflow.

**DRY**

Don't repeat yourself: A principle of software development aimed at reducing
repetition of software patterns, replacing them with abstractions or using
data normalization to avoid redundancy.

**XML**

transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. XML defines a set of rules
for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

**EOL**

Each operating system manages EOL characters in its own way. Windows uses the
original DOS convention of a CRLF (carriage return plus a line feed), while
Linux and Mac use only a LF (line feed).

**FEA**

and app developers to start a product in a remote environment and communicate
with its API. The PIM API is not intended to manage stateless services, to be
a job management system, or a fully featured service orchestration API. Its
purpose is to expose a minimum feature set for managing service-oriented apps.

**PMM**

Product marketing manager: The title of an Ansys person who can approve an open
source project for an Ansys product for public release.

*PR**

Pull request: A notification to a development team that a branch or fork of
some code has changes that are ready to be reviewed. A PR allows the team to
discuss, comment, and approve the proposed changes before they are merged into
the main repository.

**PSD**

Power spectral density: A type of frequency-domain analysis in vibration analysis
that is a measure of a signal's power content versus frequency. The 
`Dynamic simulation of a printed circuit board assembly
<https://examples.mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/technology_showcase_examples/techdemo-20/ex_20-tecPCB.html>`_
example in the PyMAPDL documentation shows how to import an existing FEA
(finite element analysis) model and run a modal and PSD analysis. 

**PyPA**

used in Python packaging. The software developed through the PyPA is used to package,
share, and install Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable
Python software such as PyPI, the Python Package Index.

**PyPI**

Python Package Index: A repository of software for the Python programming language.
PyPI helps you find and install software developed and shared by the Python community.

**REST**

Representational state transfer: A software architectural style that provides
interoperability between computer systems over the internet. REST is based on
simple and standardized protocols, like HTTP, which is the backbone of the
internet. It emphasizes a stateless client-server interaction, meaning each
request should contain all the necessary information to be understood by the
server, without relying on any previous interactions. This simplicity and
standardization make it easy for different systems to communicate and exchange
data effectively.

**RPC**

Remote procedure call: A powerful software communication protocol used in
distributed client-server programs. An RPC is a request message initiated
by a client program to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure
with supplied parameters. The remote server sends a response to the client,
and the app continues its process. RPC is more efficient than REST in terms of
speed, memory, and payload size. Typically, the use of REST should be limited
to short messages transferred via JSON files, and gRPC should be used for
large data transfers and bidirectional streaming.

**RMI**

Remote method invocation: An API that allows an object to invoke a method
on an object that exits in another address space, which could be on the same
machine or on a remote machine. The Java RMI is the object-oriented equivalent of
an RPC (remote procedure) for Java, with support for direct transfer of serialized
Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.

*RST*

results from a structural analysis.

reStructured Text: A file format and markup language that software developers
and technical documentation writers use to produce documentation for Python-based

measurement with an official status in nearly every country in the world
and is employed in science, technology, industry, and everyday commerce.

**SSH**

Secure shell protocol: A cryptographic network protocol for operating network
services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications
are remote login and command-line execution.

**TDD**

Test-driven development: A software development process that relies on software
requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.
Software development is then tracked by repeatedly testing the software
against all use cases.

**UDF**

User-defined function. Custom logic for a computation defined by a user
that can then be reused multiple types in the user environment. Python UDFs
are scalar functions that return a value for each row passed to them. In
Python, UDFs can be applied directly in the dataframes and SQL data databases.

by Microsoft with the Electron Framework. It is available for Windows,
Linux, and macOS. VS Code supports debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent
