Project approval and public release
===================================

Most of the projects in the `Ansys organization <Ansys GitHub organization_>`_ 
expose the functionality of Ansys products. Due to intellectual property reasons,
the public release of a PyAnsys library must go through a project approval process.

First step
----------

.. danger::
    Open-source allows users not only to view the source code, but also to modify, share, and reuse it under specific conditions.
    It differs from making it public as anyone can use and build upon the content.
    Do not commit any proprietary information belonging either to Ansys or to external sources. If you are uncertain, consult your manager.

To trigger the public release process, project leads must first complete the
`open source request form`_.

This form lets the different parties involved in the public release process know that
there is a request to release a project. If your intent is to release an Ansys open
source project, then continue to the next section.

Approval process
----------------

The approval process is divided into three parts:

.. grid:: 3
    
    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`file-badge` Managerial
       :link: managerial
       :link-type: ref

       Ensures that direct managers, general managers, and the chief technology
       officer are aware of the project and approve it.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`law` Legal
       :link: legal
       :link-type: ref

       Ensures that the project adheres to a legal framework that protects
       Ansys intellectual property.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`gear` Technical
       :link: technical
       :link-type: ref

       Ensures that the project complies with Ansys software guidelines and best practices.


.. important::

    An approval from each of these three parts is required to release a project to the public.
    Once all approvals are received, a project can be published to the :ref:`Public PyPI`.


When releasing a project to the public, you must perform these tasks:

* Coordinate with the product line development team, if applicable.
* Maintain the project by means of fixing bugs and providing support for new releases.
* Uphold Ansys' reputation in the open source community.

Once all three approvals have been awarded, project leads must then complete
the `open source request form`_.

This form serves as a final checklist to verify that all approvals have been processed
and to formalize the OSS approval process as a final record. For more information, see
:ref:`Questions asked on the OSS approval request form`.

Managerial
^^^^^^^^^^

The managerial part of the approval process ensures that the direct manager,
general managers, vice presidents, or the chief technology officer are aware of
the project's existence and status.

A project must be classified into one of these categories, determining the
number of administrative reviews and approvals needed:

.. grid:: 3
    
    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`repo` Documentation projects

        Documentation projects must have direct manager approval, legal review, and
        documentation proofing. No source code other than documentation files
        is allowed.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`tools` Tool projects

        Tool projects require direct manager and business unit's general
        manager approval. No product source code is allowed.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`container` Library projects

        Library projects interfacing and wrapping any Ansys products require
        approval from the direct manager, product line, and the chief
        technology officer. No product source code is allowed.

.. note::

    For multi-physics and tools impacting several products, you must have approval from
    the chief technology officer for Ansys. For flagship-related projects, you must have
    general manager or vice president approval.


Legal
^^^^^

Legal review approval ensures that the entire project complies with Ansys'
legal policies.

Click the following button to complete the legal review request form for open sourcing the code:

These checks are required when performing the legal review of the project:

.. card:: |uncheck| The project contains the right licensing.

    | |uncheck| The project has the correct license.
    | |uncheck| The contribution does not contain any strong encryption.
    | |uncheck| Ansys official logos and branding images are used in the project.
    | |uncheck| The Ansys copyright appears in the correct location as required by the
       Legal department.
    | |uncheck| The copyright has the proper formatting:

    | |uncheck| The contribution does not embody any unapproved Ansys intellectual
      property for open sourcing.
    | |uncheck| The contribution does not embody any inventions for which Ansys has

    | |uncheck| Any third-party open source code included in the contribution has been
      reviewed for security vulnerabilities and includes their license files in
      the repository.

Open source dependencies not distributed as part of the project do not need
their licenses included in the Ansys repository. Examples include dependent
Node Package Manager (``npm``) modules or Python packages from PyPI.

Technical

Technical approval ensures that the project follows the best and latest
software development practices. Request a technical review by sending an email
to `pyansys.core@ansys.com <mailto:pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_.
