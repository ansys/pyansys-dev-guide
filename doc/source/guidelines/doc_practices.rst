Documentation Practices
=======================
PyAnsys documentation must not only be written but also maintained. If you are new
to writing developer documentation, see the `Google Developer Documentation Style
Guide <https://developers.google.com/style/articles>`_. It provides editorial guidelines
for writing clear and consistent developer documentation, allowing this guide to supply
guidance specific to PyAnsys library documentation.

When writing developer documentation, the relationship between code and documenation is
key. To keep documentation up to date with rapdily evolving code:

- Minimize the content footprint
- Write `timeless documentation <https://developers.google.com/style/timeless-documentation>`_
- Support contributions from both inside and outside of the development team
- Perform periodic reviews

Understanding Documentation Sources
------------------------------------
The generation of PyAnsys documentation uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ 
and an Ansys-branded theme (`pyansys-sphinx-theme <https://github.com/pyansys/pyansys-sphinx-theme>`_)
to assemble content in:

- Docstrings
- reStructuredText (RST) files
- Python (PY) example files

Docstrings
~~~~~~~~~~
Docstrings must be formatted so that Sphinx can parse them. You can use either of these
Sphinx extensions:
 
 - `numpydoc <https://pypi.org/project/numpydoc/>`_
 - `napoleon <https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-napoleon/>`_

The ``numpydoc`` extension is generally preferred because it supports an API
documentation structure with one page per method, providing Python community
members with documentation like that generated by `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
and `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_. If, however, your API is very linear, you
might prefer the  ``napoleon`` extension because it supports a documentation
structure where everything needed to solve a certain problem can be shown on one page.

The ``numpydoc`` extension provides its own `style guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_
and a `user guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that explains how to use
the extension with Sphinx. The ``napoleon`` extension, which parses both numpy and Google
style docstrings, refers you to the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_.

Regardless of the extension that you choose for generating documentation, we
recommend the use of numpy-style docstrings so that there is consistency
across PyAnsys libraries. For more information, see :ref:`api_documentation`.

RST Files
~~~~~~~~~
To provide general usage information in your documentation, use your favorite editor to
create RST files that you then place in the repository's ``doc\`` directory. The ``index.rst``
file in the ``doc\source`` directory defines the first level of your documentation hierarchy.
The ``toctree`` directive indicates the maximum number of heading levels that the documentation
is to display. Below this directive are the directory names for your documentation sections.
Each documentation section has its own ``index.rst`` file.

For example, if you open the ``index.rst`` file in the ``doc\source`` directory in the
``dev-guide`` repository, you will see that the ``toctree`` direction indicates that the
*PyAnsys Developer's Guide* is to display a maximum of three heading levels. You then
see the section structure for this guide:

.. code::

   overview/index
   guidelines/index
   library_description/index
   coding_style/index
   documentation_style/index

While you do not include the ``.rst`` extension when defining the section structure, the
index file referenced for each section must be named ``index.rst``. If you open ``index.rst``
in ``doc\source\overview``, you can see that it describes how the PyAnsys project provides
Python libraries that expose Ansys technologies to the Python ecosystem. 

After you build documentation locally as described in :ref:`doc_building`, the first-level
heading in the ``index.rst`` file for each documentation section is shown as clickable link
in the header of the documentation's generated HTML output. For more information on defining
a documentation structure, see the `Sphinx Getting Started <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_
guide.

Within RST files, heading titles are followed by a line having a string of characters that is
the same length as the heading title. If the length of the characters
under the heading title do not match the length of the heading title, Sphinx generates a warning.

For consistency within PyAnsys libraries, the use of these special characters is recommended for
headings but are not enforced:

- For first-level headings, use ====.
- For second-level headings, use ---.
- For third-level headings, use ~~~. 

For comprehensive syntax information, see the `reStrucutredText Markup Specification
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_.

Because you need to be familiar with the content in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*, page through
its HTML pages and then explore the RST files in its repository. This will help you to understand
the syntax and see how RST files have been nested to create this guide. 

Examples
~~~~~~~~
Examples come in two formats:

- Basic code snippets demonstrating some functionality
- Full-fledged standalone examples that are meant to be run as individual downloadable scripts

Basic code snippets should be placed in the ``doc/source`` directory. Full-fledged
standalone examples must be placed in the ``examples`` directory at the root of the
repository. All of these examples, which should be PEP 8-compliant, are compiled dynamically
during the build process. Always ensure that your examples run properly locally because
they will be verified through the CI performed via GitHub Actions.

Adding a new standalone example consists of placing it in an applicable subfolder in the ``examples``
directory. If none of the existing directories match the category of your example, create
a new subfolder with a ``README.txt`` file describing the new category. Because these examples
are built using the `Sphinx-Gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_
extension, you must follow its `coding guidelines <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_.

PyMAPDL provides a self-demonstrating example of how to `add an example reference key <https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/examples/03-tips-n-tricks/00-example-template.html#ref-how-to-add-an-example-reference-key>`_. 

Accessing a Library's Documentation
-----------------------------------
Documentation for the latest stable release of a PyAnsys library is accessible
from its repository. You can generally access the latest development version of the
documentation tracking the ``main`` branch by adding the prefix ``dev.`` to
the URL for the latest stable release.

For example, consider PyAEDT documentation:

- The URL for documentation of the latest stable release is `<https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/>`_.
- The URL for documentation of the lastest development version is `<https://dev.aedtdocs.pyansys.com/>`_.

The latest development versions of both the library and its documentation are automatically kept
up-to-date via GitHub actions.

To make documentation changes, you create a branch with a name that begins with a prefix of
``doc/`` that is then followed by a short description of what you are changing. For more
information, see :ref:`branch_naming`.

As you are making changes in this branch, you want to periodically generate the documentation
locally so that you can test your changes before you create a GitHub pull request. For more
information, see :ref:`doc_building`. It is also possible for you to build a PDF
of your documentation locally on Windows as described in :ref:`pdf_building`.

.. _cloning:

Cloning a GitHub Repository
---------------------------
Contributing to a GitHub repository requires that you first clone the repository. While developers
likely know many ways to do this, technical documentation specialists may need to review the
following instructions for using either Windows PowerShell or GitBash to clone a GitHub repository.

Using Windows PowerShell to Clone a GitHub Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use Windows PowerShell to clone a GitHub repository:

#. In Windows PowerShell, navigate to the directory on your machine where you want
   to clone GitHub repositories.

#. Go to the `PyAnsys GitHub account <https://github.com/pyansys>`_ and select the
   repository that you want to clone.

   Because the list of repositories is quite long, you can use the ``Find
   a repository`` option to search for the repository that you want to clone. For
   example, you can seach for "theme" to find the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository.  

#. In the upper right corner of the repository, click the green ``Code`` button to
   drop down a list of options.

#. To the right of the ``HTTPS`` option, click the clipboard icon to copy the path to
   the repository.
 
#. Go back to Windows Powershell and type ``git clone`` and then click the right
   mouse button to paste the copied path.

#. Press ``Enter`` to copy the files in the repository to your local directory.

#. Type ``ls`` to see a list of the files now in the folder for this repository
   in your local directory. 

.. note::
   In Anaconda Powershell, typing ``dir`` is the equivalent to typing ``ls``.

Using GitBash to Clone a GitHub Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use GitBase to clone a GitHub repository:

#. In the directory where you want to clone PyAnsys repositories, right-click and
   select ``GitBash Here``.

#. Type ``git clone`` followed by the address of the repo to clone.


For example, you clone the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository with:
  
.. code::
  
  git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pyansys-sphinx-theme

.. _push_changes:

Pushing Changes to the GitHub Repository
----------------------------------------
As you make changes in your ``doc/`` branch, you want to periodically test then in
local documentation builds as described in :ref:`doc_building`. After you resolve
any issues and are satisfied with what apears in a local build, you are ready
to push your changes to the library's GitHub repository. To accomplish this,
you can use either Git commands or Git Extensions. 

Using Git Commands to Push Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use Git commands to push your changes to the GitHub repository:

#. In Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned 
   the GitHub repository.

#. Type ``git status`` to see a summary of the changes that you have made in this
   directory.

#. Create a branch by entering ``git checkout -b`` followed by the name to give
   this branch.
   
   The option ``-b`` is for adding a branch. If you were adding a branch with documentation
   changes to the ``Contributing`` topic, you might enter:
   
   .. code::

    git checkout -b doc/edit_contributing

#. Enter ``git add .`` to stage the changed files to commit.

#. Enter ``git status`` again to see all files that are staged for committing in green.

#. If any unnecessary files are staged, delete them in File Explorer and then enter ``git status`` 
   again to ensure that the final red line indicates that these files have been deleted.

#. If you make any additional file changes, type ``git add .`` again to restage the files to
   commit.

#. When finished, commit your changes to GitHub history by entering ``git commit -m`` followed by
   a description in quotation marks.
   
   For the given example, you might enter:
   
   .. code::

    git commit -m "Edit Contributing topic" 
   
   The number of files changed are shown, followed by the number of insertions and deletions.
   A create mode or rename doc action is then shown for each file.

#. For the first push of a newly created branch, enter ``git push --set-upstream origin``,
   followed by the branch name.
   
   For the given example, you would enter:
      
   .. code::
   
    git push --set-upstream origin doc/edit_contributing

   .. note::
      For any subsequent push, you would simply use ``git push``.
   
#. Create the PR as described in :ref:`create_pr`.

Using Git Extensions to Push Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use Git Extensions to push your changes to the GitHub repository:

#. In Git Extensions, select ``Commands > Create branch`` and then provide a name for
   the branch that you want to create, using the prefix ``doc/`` followed by a short
   description of what you intend to change.
   
#. Make your documentation changes in the directory where you cloned the library's
   GitHub reposity.   

#. Test your changes in local documentation builds. For more information, see
   :ref:`doc_building`.

#. In Git Extensions, click ``Commit`` to see the files that have been changed in your
   local directory.
   
#. In the window that opens, stage the files to commit, add a commit message, and then
   click ``Commit``.

#. Do a pull from the GitHub repository to your local directory to ensure that there
   are no conflicts with what is in your branch. If there are conflicts, resolve
   them.

#. Do a push of your branch to the GitHub repsitory.

#. Create the PR as described in :ref:`create_pr`.


.. _create_pr:

Creating the GitHub PR
----------------------
Regardless of what method you used to push your changes, do the following to create
the GitHub PR:

#. Go to the GitHub reposity, where you will see an entry for your pushed branch.

#. If the pushed branch resolves an issue, in its description, type ``Resolves #``
   and select from the list of issues that appears.

#. Create either a PR or draft PR, making the title a simple statement because
   our `automatic release generator <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes>`_
   uses this PR title in the automatic rendering of release notes.

   If your PR is ready for review, select ``Create pull request``. Otherwise,
   select ``Create draft pull request`` and mark it as ready for review once
   you it includes all of your changes and you are satisified with it. 

   If you need to change a PR title, to its right, click the ``Edit`` button,
   which becomes a ``Save`` button while you are in editing mode.

.. _doc_building:

Building Documentation Locally
------------------------------
You can build and verify the HTML documentation for a PyAnsys library locally
by installing Sphinx and other documentation build dependencies.

Setting Up Your Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anaconda provides Python and tools, such as a Python IDE (Interactive Development Environment),
a Python command line editor, and Sphinx dependencies. This gives you what you need to get up
and running.

#. Install the `Anaconda individual edition <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.

#. If a PyAnsys library already exists, create a directory in which to place a clone of its GitHub repository.

#. Clone the PyAnsys library's GitHub repository. For more information, see :ref:`cloning`.

#. If you have not yet cloned the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository, clone it.

Installing Build Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
You can build documentation for the ``dev_guide`` and ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repositories without
installing a PyAnsys library in development mode. However, when you push changes that you have made
in a local branch to the GitHub repository for other PyAnsys libraries, CI checks typically require
that the full library is installed.

#. In Anaconda Powershell, navigate to the base directory in the library's cloned repository.

#. If your library must be installed in development mode, enter:
   
   .. code::

    pip install -e .

#. To install the build requirements for generating documentation, enter:
   
   .. code::

    pip install -r requirements_docs.txt

#. If you are running on a Linux/Mac OS, to build the documentation, enter:
   
   .. code::

    make -C doc html

#. If you are running on Windows, to build the documentation, enter two
   commands:
   
   .. code::
  
    cd doc
    .\make.bat html


   As Sphinx is generating HTML output in the library's ``..\doc\_build\html`` folder,
   Anaconda Powershell displays any errors and warnings for unexpected indentations,
   bad target locations for links, missing files, and extra files included in the
   repository but not referenced by any ``index.rst`` file.
   
#. Resolve all indicated issues before submitting a pull request (PR) to push
   your changes to the library's GitHub repository. 
   
#. After local documentation builds successfully, navigate to ``doc/_build/html/``
   and use your browser to open the ``index.html`` file to review the documentation,
   repeating the local build process until there are no errors or obvious issues.

.. note::
   You can use ``make.bat`` to build more than HTML output. To view a summary of
   all target options, enter ``make.bat``.

Your next step is to push your changes to the library's GitHub repository
by creating a PR. For more information, see :ref:`create_pr`.

.. _pdf_building:

Building a PDF of Your Documentation Locally
--------------------------------------------
Some libraries supply a link to a PDF of the documentation under 'Assets' in the 
release notes for a version. On Linux, building this PDF can be set up as an
automated process. On Windows, building a PDF is a manual process that you run
locally:

#. Install `MiKTeX <https://miktex.org/download>`_ for Windows, selecting the
   recommended option for installing it for only your own use.
#. From the Windows Start menu, start the MiKTeX Console.
#. On the Welcome page, click ``Check for updates`` and install any available
   updates.
#. Install the latest version of Strawbery Perl, which enables you to build
   LaTeX files, accepting the default installation location (``C:\Strawberry\``).
#. In the Command Prompt window, type ``perl-v`` to test that you installation is
   successful.  
#. Ensure that these Perl directory locations have been added to your ``Path``
   system environment variable:
   
   - C:/Strawberry/c/bin
   - C:/Strawberry/perl/site/bin
   - C:/Strawberry/perl/bin


#. In Anaconda PowerShell, navigate to the ``doc`` directory with:
   
   .. code::

    cd C:\AnsysDev\GitRepos\PyAnsys\dev-guide\doc


#. Generate LaTeX files and a PDF from these files in ``..\doc\build\latex``
   with:

   .. code::

    .\make latexpdf
