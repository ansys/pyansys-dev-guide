Documentation Practices
=======================
The generation of documentation uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__
and an Ansys-branded theme. Documentation is built from docstrings, reStructuredText
(RST) files, and Python (PY) example files.

Docstrings
----------
Docstrings must be formatted so that Sphinx can parse them. You can use either the 
``numpydoc``or ``napoleon`` Sphinx extension:
 
 - `numpydoc <https://pypi.org/project/numpydoc/>`_
 - `napoleon <https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-napoleon/>`_

The ``numpydoc`` extension is generally preferred because it supports an API
documentation structure with one page per method, providing Python community
members with documentation like that generated by `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
and `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_. If, however, your API is very linear, you
might prefer the  ``napoleon`` extension because it supports a documentation
structure where everything needed to solve a certain problem can be shown on one page.

The ``numpydoc`` extension provides its own `style guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_
and a `user guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that explains how to use
the extension with Sphinx. The ``napoleon`` extension, which parses both numpy and Google
style docstrings, refers you to the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_.

This guide provides additional API documentation guidelines in :ref:`api_documentation`.

RST Files
---------
To provide general usage information in your documentation, you use your favorite editor to
create RST files that you then place in the repository's ``doc/`` directory. The ``index.rst``
file in the ``doc\source`` directory defines the first level of the your documentation hierarchy.
The ``toctree`` directive indicates the maximum number of heading levels that the documentation
is to display. Below this directive are the directory names for your documentation sections.
Each documentation section has its own ``index.rst`` file.

For example, if you open the ``index.rst`` file in the ``doc\source`` directory in the
``dev-guide`` repository, you will see that the ``toctree`` direction indicates that the
*PyAnsys Developer's Guide* is to display a maximum of three heading levels. You then
see the section structure for this guide:

.. code::

   overview/index
   guidelines/index
   library_description/index
   coding_style/index
   documentation_style/index

While you do not include the ``.rst`` extension when defining the section structure, the
index file referenced for each section must be named ``index.rst``. If you open ``index.rst``
in ``doc\source\overview``, you can see that it describes how the PyAnsys project provides
Python libraries that expose Ansys technologies to the Python ecosystem. 

After you build documenatation locally as described in :ref:`doc_building`, the first-level
heading in the ``index.rst`` file for each docuemntation section is shown as clickable link
in the header of the documentation's generated HTML output.

You can nest RST files. Plenty of examples of nested RST files are available in the PyAnsys
libraries on GitHub. Because you need to be familiar with the content in the *PyAnsys Developer's
Guide*, paging through this doc and exploring its repository will help you better
understand how RST files are used. For more information on defining documentation
structure, see the `Sphinx Getting Started <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_
documentation.

Examples
--------
Examples come in two formats:

- Basic code snippets demonstrating some functionality
- Full-fledged standalone examples that are meant to be run as individual downloadable scripts

Basic code snippets should be placed in the ``doc/source`` directory. Full-fledged
standalone examples must be placed in the ``examples`` directory at the root of the
repository. All of these examples, which should be PEP 8-compliant, are compiled dynamically
during the build process. Always ensure that your examples run properly locally because
they will be verified through the CI performed via GitHub Actions.

Adding a New Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding a standalone example consists of placing it in an applicable subfolder in the ``examples``
directory. If none of the existing directories match the category of your example, create
a new subfolder with a ``README.txt`` file describing the new category. Because these examples
are built using the `Sphinx-Gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_
extension, you must follow its `coding guidelines <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_.

PyMAPDL provides a self-demonstrating example of how to `add an example reference key <https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/examples/03-tips-n-tricks/00-example-template.html#ref-how-to-add-an-example-reference-key>`_. 

Accessing a Library's Documentation
-----------------------------------
Documentation for the latest stable release of a PyAnsys library is accessible
from its repository. You can generally access the latest development version of the
documentation tracking the ``main`` branch by adding the prefix ``dev.`` to
the URL for the latest stable release. For example, the URL for documentation of the
latest stable release of PyAEDT is `<https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/>`_, and
the URL for the latest documentation for the development version of PyAEDT is
`<https://dev.aedtdocs.pyansys.com/>`_. The latest development versions of both
the library and its documentation are kept up-to-date automatically via GitHub actions.

.. _doc_building:

Building Documentation Locally
------------------------------
You can build and verify the HTML documentation for a PyAnsys library locally
by installing Sphinx and other documentation build dependencies.

Setting Up Your Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anaconda provides Python and tools, such as a Python IDE (Interactive Development Environment),
a Python command line editor, and Sphinx dependencies. This gives you what you need to get up
and running.

#. Install the `Anaconda individual edition <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.

#. If a PyAnsys library already exists, create a directory in which to place a clone of its GitHub repository.

#. Clone the PyAnsys library's repository. For more information, see :ref:`cloning`.

#. If you have not yet cloned the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository, clone it.

Installing Build Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
You can build documentation for the ``dev_guide`` and ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repositories without
installing a PyAnsys library in development mode. However, when you push changes that you have made
in a local branch to the GitHub repository for other PyAnsys libraries, CI checks typically require
that the full library is installed.

#. In Anaconda Powershell, navigate to the base directory in the library's cloned repository.

#. If your library must be installed in development mode, enter:
   
   .. code::

    pip install -e .

#. To install the build requirements for generating documentation, enter:
   
   .. code::

    pip install -r requirements_docs.txt

#. If you are running on a Linux/Mac OS, to build the documentation, enter:
   
   .. code::

    make -C doc html

#. If you are running on Windows, to build the documentation, enter two
   commands:
   
   .. code::
  
    cd doc
    make.bat html


   As Sphinx is generating HTML output in the library's ``doc\_build\html`` folder,
   Anaconda Powershell displays any errors and warnings for unexpected indentations,
   bad target locations for links, missing files, and extra files included in the
   repository but not referenced by any ``index.rst`` file.
   
#. Resolve all indicated issues before submitting a pull request (PR) to push
   your changes to the library's GitHub repository. 
   
#. After local documentation builds successfully, navigate to ``doc/_build/html/``
   and use your browser to open the ``index.html`` file to review the documentation,
   repeating this process until there are no errors or obvious issues.

.. note::
   You can use ``make.bat`` to build more than HTML output. To view a summary of
   all target options, enter ``make.bat``.

Your next step is to push your changes to the library's GitHub repository
by creating a PR. For more information, see :ref:`create_pr`.

.. _cloning:

Cloning a GitHub Repository
---------------------------
While developers likely know how to clone a GitHub repository, technical documentation
specialists may not know how to do this. You can easily use either Windows PowerShell
commands or GitBash.

Using Windows PowerShell to Clone a GitHub Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. In Windows PowerShell, navigate to where you clone repositories on your machine.

#. Go to the `PyAnsys GitHub account <https://github.com/pyansys>`_ and select the
   repository that you want to clone.

   Because the list of repositories is quite long, you might want to use the ``Find
   a repository`` option to search for the repository that you want to clone. For
   example, you can seach for "theme" to find the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository.  

#. On the right, click the green ``Code`` button to drop down a list of options.

#. To the right of the HTTPS entry, click the clipboard icon to copy the path to
   the repository.
 
#. Go back to Windows Powershell and type ``git clone`` and then click the right
   mouse button to paste the copied path.

#. Press ``Enter`` to copy the files in the repository to yoour local directory.

#. Type ``ls`` to see a list of the files now in your local directory. 

.. note::
   In Anaconda Powershell, typing ``dir`` is the equivalent to typing ``ls``.

Using GitBash to Clone a GitHub Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. In the folder where you clone PyAnsys repositories, right-click and select
   ``GitBash Here``.

#. Type ``git clone`` followed by the address of the repo to clone.

For example, to clone the ``pyansys-sphinx-theme`` repository, you would
enter:
  
.. code::
  
  git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pyansys-sphinx-theme

.. _create_pr:

Pushing Changes to the GitHub Repository
----------------------------------------
Once you have tested your changes in local documentation builds and are
satisifed with them, you can push them to the library's GitHub repository. 
You can use Git commands or Git Extension to accomplish this. 

For documentation changes, the branch name should have a prefix of ``doc\``
followed by a short description of what you've changed. For more information, see
:ref:`branch_naming`.

Using Git Commands to Push Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This procedure assumes that you are using Git Commands to push your changes to the
GitHub repository.

#. In Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned 
   the GitHub reposity.

#. Type ``git status`` to see a summary of the changes that you have made in this
   directory.

#. Create a branch by entering ``git checkout -b`` followed by the name to give
   this branch.
   
   The option ``-b`` is for adding a branch. If you were adding a branch with documentation
   changes to the ``Contributing`` topic, you might enter:
   
   .. code::

    git checkout -b edit_contributing
   
#. To add and check out this new branch, enter ``git add checkout -b doc/`` followed by
   the branch name that you specified in the previous step.

#. Enter ``git add .`` to stage the changed files to commit.

#. Enter ``git status`` again to see all files that are staged for committing in green.

#. If any unnecessary files are staged, delete them in File Explorer and then enter ``git status`` 
   again to ensure that the final red line indicates that these files have been deleted.

#. If you make any additional file changes, type ``git add .`` again to restage the files to
   commit.

#. When finished, commit your changes to GitHub history by entering ``git commit -m`` followed by
   a description in quotation marks.
   
   For the given example, you might enter:
   
   .. code::

    git commit -m "Edit Contributing topic" 
   
   The number of files changed are shown, followed by the number of insertions and deletions.
   A create mode or rename doc action is then shown for each file.

#. Enter ``git push``, which shows a message like this to indicate that changed files have not
   been uploaded yet:
   
   .. code::
   
    fatal: The current branch doc/edit_contributing has no upstream branch.

#. To push the  current branch and set the remote as upstream, enter the following,
   replacing the branch name shown with your branch name:
   
   .. code::
   
    git push --set-upstream origin doc/edit_contributing

#. Copy the text shown and paste it into the command line and run it.

#. Complete the PR as described in :ref:`complete_pr`.

Using Git Extensions to Push Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This procedure assumes that you are using Git Extensions to push your changes to the
GitHub repository.

#. In Git Extensions, select ``Commands > Create branch`` and then provide a name for
   the branch that you want to create, using the prefix ``doc`` followed by a short
   description of what you intend to change.
   
#. Make your documentation changes in the directory where you cloned the library's
   GitHub reposity.   

#. Test your changes in local documentation builds. For more information, see
   :ref:`doc_building`.

#. In Git Extensions, click ``Commit`` to see the files that have been changed in your
   local directory.
   
#. In the window that opens, stage the files to commit, add a commit message, and then
   click ``Commit``.

#. Do a pull from the GitHub repository to your local directory to ensure that there
   are no conflicts with what is in your branch. If there are conflicts, resolve
   them.

#. Do a push of your branch to the GitHub repsitory.

#. Complete the PR as described in :ref:`complete_pr`.

.. _complete_pr:

Completing the GetHub PR
-------------------------
#. Go to the GitHub reposity, where you will see an entry for your pushed branch.

#. If the pushed branch resolves an issue, in its description, type ``Resolves #``
   and select from the list of issues that appears.

#. Create the PR, making title a simple statement because this title is rendered
   in our `automatic release generator <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes>`_.

#. If you are not ready to have someone review the PR, change its title to include
   a prefix of ``WIP``, which indicates ``Work in Progress``.

   There is an ``Edit`` button to the right of the title, which becomes a ``Save``
   button when you are in the editing mode.

#. When the PR is ready for review, remove the ``WIP`` prefix if applicable and
   then assign the appropriate reviewer.
