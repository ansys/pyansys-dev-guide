##########################

Python's vast ecosystem of mathematical and scientific computing tools
is widely used for data analysis. PyAnsys is a collection of Python-based,
open source projects tailored specifically for engineers who want to automate
their simulation workflows and extend the capabilities of Ansys products.

This section describes Python client libraries and explains how to
set up your development environment for contributing to the documentation
for PyAnsys libraries.

- A Python client library is a collection of source files.
- A package is a superset of the Python client library. It includes all source
  files and the supporting files needed to install and use the library.

Additionally, this section provides essential information for
documenting PyAnsys libraries and includes links to all the many
resources relevant to creating and maintaining this documentation. The
:ref:`resources_writers` page and the :ref:`content_how_tos` section are
likely to be the content that you refer to most as you become proficient
in contributing to PyAnsys documentation.
