Style and formatting resources
------------------------------
The following alphabetized list of resources provide guidelines for writing PyAnsys
documentation. These resources provide you with an understanding of how to write
and format PyAnsys documentation content correctly in various types of source files.

- `GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec <Markdown_GitHub_flavored_spec_>`_: Describes how GitHub
  Flavored Markdown is a dialect of Markdown supported for user content on GitHub.com and
  GitHub Enterprise. Generally, all manually written source files for PyAnsys documentation
  are RST files. However, some projects use a GitHub Flavored Markdown (MD) file for the
  project's README file. For more information, see :ref:`readme_files`.
- `Google developer documentation style guide <Google_dev_doc_style_guide_>`_: Provides
  guidance on the writing style used for PyAnsys documentation.
- `Material for Sphinx <Material_for_Sphinx_>`_: Provides guidance on authoring in
  reStructuredText when using Sphinx to generate documentation and includes a
  reStructuredText cheat sheet.
- `numpydoc Style guide <numpydoc_style_guide_>`_: Provides the syntax and best practices for
  writing docstrings in PY files when the ``numpydoc`` extension for Sphinx is used. Docstrings
  describe Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. This guide's overview also provides
  links to standard Python code conventions, additional PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) related
  to the documentation of code, and common code style checkers.
- `PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code <PEP8_>`_: Provides guidance on the Python coding
  style that PyAnsys libraries use.
- `Python documentation <Python_doc_>`_: Provides the official documentation published by the
  Python organization for Python for developers at all levels.
- `Quick reStructuredText <Quick_RST_>`_: Provides a summary of reStructuredText
  syntax with links to the `reStructuredText Markup Specification <RST_markup_spec_>`_
  for more comprehensive information.
- `reStructuredText Markup Specification <RST_markup_spec_>`_: Provides a quick reStructuredText
  syntax overview, which explains that the parser is a component of `Docutils <Docutils_>`_,
  an open source text-processing system for plaintext documentation. It then provides the complete
  technical specification.
- `reStructuredText Markup Syntax and Parser Component of Docutils <RST_markup_syntax_parser_>`_:
  Provides a description of reStructuredText and links to user, reference, and developer
  documentation, including a reStructuredText cheat sheet.
- `reStructuredText Primer <RST_primer_>`_: Provides introductory documentation on reStructuredText
  concepts and syntax as part of the `documentation <Sphinx_>`_.
- `Style guide for Sphinx-based documentation <Style_guide_Sphinx_doc_>`_: Provides coding
  standards for Sphinx-based documentation.
- `Using Markdown and Liquid in GitHub Docs <GitHub_doc_flavored_markdown_>`_: Provides an
  explanation of GitHub Flavored Markdown and explains how GitHub docs use `Liquid <Liquid_>`_
  syntax to expand the functionality to provide accessible tables, maintainable links, versioning,
  variables, and chunks of reusable content.

.. _tool_resources:

Tool resources
--------------
The following alphabetized list of resources are for tools used in the writing and
building of PyAnsys documentation.

- `Ansys Python Manager <Ansys_Python_Manager_repository_>`_: Provides a cross-platform
  QT app for installing Python and managing your Python environment, including creating
  virtual environments, launching a command console, installing PyAnsys packages, and
  viewing PyAnsys documentation.
- `Ansys Sphinx Theme <Ansys_Sphinx_theme_repo_>`_: Provides an Ansys-branded extension
  of the popular `PyData Sphinx Theme <PyData_Sphinx_theme_>`_ that is used to generate
  PyAnsys documentation.
- `Ansys templates <Ansys_templates_>`_: Provides templates for creating PyAnsys projects
  that are compliant with PyAnsys guidelines.
- `Git`_: Provides a distributed version control system for tracking changes
  in source code during software development.
- `Git Extensions`_: Provides a GUI client for Git.
- `GitHub`_:  Provides a web-based platform that uses Git as its underlying
  version control system but goes way beyond version control, offering a
  collaborative environment for hosting, managing, and sharing Git repositories.
- `GitHub Desktop`_: Provides a GUI client for Git.
- `Notepad\+\+ <Notepadpp_>`_: Provides an open source code text and code editor for use
  on Microsoft Windows, supporting around 80 programming languages with syntax
  highlighting and code folding.
- `pip`_: Provides a package manager for installing Python packages from the
  `Python Package Index <Python_Package_Index_>`_ (PyPI).
- `pre-commit`_: Provides for checking the conformance of your code
  against predefined code style conventions.
- `Python`_: Provides a general-purpose programming language that runs on
  almost all system architectures and is used for a wide range of applications
  in different fields.
- `Python in Visual Studio Code <Python_in_VSC_>`_: Provides an extension
  that makes `Visual Studio Code <VSC_>`_ an excellent Python editor.
- `Sphinx <Sphinx_>`_: Provides a Python documentation generator for generating documentation
  from RST, MD, and PY files.
- `Vale`_: Provides for checking RST and MD files for consistent
  style and voice.
- `Visual Studio Code <VSC_>`_: Provides a lightweight but powerful source
  code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for WIndows , macOS, and Linux.

.. note::

  For information on documentation style tools that might be implemented in
  a PyAnsys project but are not necessarily described on this page, see
  :ref:`doc_style_tools`.
