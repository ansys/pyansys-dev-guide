You can use this example as a template\nfor adding your examples.\n\nEach example should have a reference tag/key in the form:\n\n``.. _<example-name>_example:``.\n\nThe ``.. _`` is necessary. Everything that follows is your reference tag, which\ncan potentially be used within a docstring. All references should be in snake case.\n\nThe first section, which is text, provides a brief overview of what the example is.\nWhen using this example as a template, you would change the title to an appropriate\none for your example.\n\nAdd new examples as Python scripts like this:\n\n``examples/<index>-<directory-name>/<some-example>.py``\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Avoid creating directories unless absolutely necessary. If you *must*\n   create a directory, make sure to add a ``README.txt`` file containing a\n   reference, a title, and a one-sentence description of the directory.\n   Otherwise, Sphinx ignores the new directory.</p></div>\n\nExample file names should use snake case and be hyphen-separated:\n\n``some-example.py``\n\nAfter this text section is the first code block. This is where you\ntypically set up your imports.\n"
