PyAnsys developer's guide
=========================

The `PyAnsys developer's guide <https://dev.docs.pyansys.com>`_ is the central
document for:

- Ansys developers who want to create and "own" PyAnsys libraries
- Anyone in the Python community who wants to contribute to a 
  PyAnsys library
- Anyone who is interested in learning more about the PyAnsys 
  project and PyAnsys libraries

This guide describes the PyAnsys project organization and administration.
It also provides how-to information and summarizes packaging, coding, and
documentation styles. It concludes with an abstractions section that explains
how apps and complex services expose only functionalities that matter to users.
