See artipacked audit rule for more information.\n\nPotential risk\n\n\n\nRemediation\n\n\n\nWhen you run git commands that require persisted credentials in subsequent steps within the same job,\nyou can ignore this audit finding. For details, see ignoring zizmor results\n\nunpinned-uses\n\nThe vulnerability is that using unpinned uses: clauses in GitHub Actions allows workflows to pull in action\ncode that can change at any time, including through branch or tag updates.\n\nFixing it is important because unpinned actions could be modified by attackers or upstream maintainers, leading\nto unexpected or malicious code execution in your workflows. See unpinned-uses audit rule for more\ninformation.\n\nPotential risk\n\n\n\nRemediation\n\n\n\nYou can use the pinact tool to automatically pin versions of actions and reusable workflows.\n\nThe ansys/actions/check-actions-security action has a trust-ansys-actions option that\nallows you to use tags for ansys/actions.\nWhen this option is enabled, you only need to pin external actions.\n\ngithub-env\n\nWriting to GITHUB_ENV or GITHUB_PATH in workflows with dangerous triggers (such as pull_request_target and\nworkflow_run) can let attackers inject arbitrary environment variables / variable contents.\n\nA fix is required because this exposure could allow attackers to run malicious code in your GitHub Actions workflows\neither implictly in subsequent steps, or by shadowing ordinary system executables (such as ssh). See\ngithub-env audit rule for more information.\n\nPotential risk\n\n\n\nRemediation\n\n\n\nThe trick is to pass state between steps using GITHUB_OUTPUT instead of GITHUB_ENV or GITHUB_PATH.\nOn Windows runners, the same principle applies when running commands in cmd or pwsh; only the syntax differs.\n\ntemplate-injection\n\nThe vulnerability is that template expansions (${{ ... }}) in GitHub Actions can allow code injection when used with\nattacker-controlled inputs, such as issue titles (github.event.issue.title which the attacker can fully control by supplying a new issue title).\n\nFixing it is important because malicious inputs could execute unintended commands, compromising the security of your workflows. See\ntemplate-injection audit rule for more information.\n\nPotential risk\n\n\n\nRemediation\n\n\n\nNotice that RUNNER_TEMP and GITHUB_WORKSPACE were not explicitly set in the env block.\nSome GitHub context variables automatically map to environment variables, such as\nrunner.temp to RUNNER_TEMP and github.workspace to GITHUB_WORKSPACE.\n\nIf a corresponding environment variable is not automatically available, you must set it in the env\nblock of the job or step where it is needed before you can use it.\n\nexcessive-permissions\n\nThe vulnerability is that workflows with excessive permissions grant more access than needed, either at the\nworkflow or job level, including through the default GITHUB_TOKEN.\n\nFixing it is important because over-scoped permissions increase the risk that a compromised workflow could\nperform unauthorized actions on your repository. See excessive-permissions audit rule for more information.\n\nPotential risk\n\n\n\nRemediation\n\n\n\nanonymous-definition\n\nThis issue is raised when workflows omit the name: field.

For a summary of the most important\nwriting guidelines, frequently review the Highlights\npage in the Goggle developer documentation style guide.\n\nUse sentence case for headings and titles in PyAnsys documentation, as specified\nin Headings and titles in the Google developer\ndocumentation style guide.\n\nUnderline (and optionally overline) titles to indicate the heading hierarchy.\nThe string of characters indicating the title level should be the same length\nas the title and must be at least as long as the title. You should have only\none top-level heading per RST file. For consistency within PyAnsys libraries,\nthe use of these characters is recommended but not enforced:\n\nFor section-level headings, use ###.\n\nFor subsection-level headings, use ===.\n\nFor subsubsection-level headings, use ---.\n\nFor subsubsubsection-level headings, use ~~~.\n\nFor paragraph-level headings, use +++.\n\nUse blank lines to separate text into paragraphs.\n\nEnsure that there are no blank spaces at the end of a line. (Running pre-commit\nfinds and removes any trailing white spaces, saving you from seeing errors\nwhen you create or push changes to a PR. For more information, see run_precommit.)\n\nAs in Python, indentation is significant. All lines of the same paragraph must be left-aligned to the\nsame level of indentation. Use spaces (and not tabs) for indentation.\n\nDo not exceed the maximum number of characters per line specified for your PyAnsys\nlibrary. While the Style guide for Sphinx-based documentation\nindicates that lines should be limited to a maximum of 79 characters, many PyAnsys\nlibraries extend this limit, sometimes to as many as 120 characters, because\ntoday’s larger screens can support longer lines.\n\nUse standard American spelling and punctuation.\n\nUse you and your rather then we and our.\n\nOmit the word “please” and replace the phrase “In order to” with “To.”\n\nItalicize a word or phrase by surrounding it in a single asterisk (*) or a\nsingle backtick (`). In PyAnsys documentation, the following are italicized: words\nor phrases to be emphasized, first occurrence of a new term, and a publication title\nthat is not a link.\n\nBold a word or phrase by surrounding it in double asterisks (**). In PyAnsys\ndocumentation, the following are in bold: words or phrases to be strongly\nemphasized and GUI (graphical user interface) components.\n\nSeparate lists from paragraphs with blank links. Begin each item in a bulleted list\nwith either a - or * followed by a space. Begin each item in a numbered\nlist with #. followed by a space. While nested lists are supported, you must\nseparate them from parent list items with blank lines and indent them appropriately.\n\nFor a horizontal list, use the hlist directive. This directive\nspecifies that list items are to display horizontally in three columns:\n\nThis is how the preceding list items, which are in a sublist, are rendered in the\ndocumentation:\n\nList item 1\n\nList item 2\n\nList item 3\n\nList item 4\n\nList item 5\n\nIndicate a code entity within text by surrounding it in double backticks\n(``). While the numpydoc Style guide\nsays to surround a code entity in a single backtick, this renders it incorrectly\nas italics in PyAnsys documentation. Surrounding it in double backticks\ncorrectly renders it in a monospaced font within a gray block.\n\nAlways follow a code entity with a noun that indicates the object type. For general\nguidelines, see Code in text in the Google developer\ndocumentation style guide.\n\nCode entities include the names of Python objects, such as packages, modules, functions,\nclasses, methods, and attributes. Code entities also include the following objects:\n\nFile paths\n\nNames of directories, files, and environment variables\n\nText to type in a command line or in a GUI component\n\nSome PyAnsys projects use the file and envvar interpretive text\nroles for names of files and environment variables:\n\nmyfile.txt\n\nMY_ENVAR\n\nRoles insert semantic markup in your source files for cross-references to named\ntargets of the type indicated by the role. Because the CSS for the\nAnsys Sphinx Theme assigns the same semantic markup to\nthe file role as it does to a filename surrounded in double backticks, it\ndoes not matter which markup you use.\n\nUse the code role to format text as a code entity if surrounding the text in double\nbackticks is problematic because it contains characters that cause regular\nexpression errors. For example, in this sentence describing the use of double backticks,\nthe code role had to be used to format the double backticks as a code entity:\n\nIf you want, you can use the code role within any sentence to identify small\npieces of inline code, individual identifiers (like function names or variable names),\nor inline code phrases. Most of the time though, using double backticks is easier.\n\nTo create a standalone code block within your documentation, use either the\ncode or code-block directive. For more information on code blocks,\nsee code_blocks.\n\nTo comment out lines in an RST file so that they do render in the documentation,\nplace two periods (..) and a space before each line that you want to hide:\n\nWhile this approach is useful if the native sphinx.ext.todo extension has not been\nadded to the extensions variable in your documentation’s Sphinx configuration\n(doc/source/conf.py) file, adding this extension is recommended. The specially\nformatted block of text for the .. todo:: directive does not render in the\ndocumentation by default. Plus, you can easily search for occurrences of this directive\nlater. For more information, see add_native_sphinx_ext.\n\nSubsequent pages describe how to use other common Sphinx roles and directives. For\ncomprehensive lists of roles and directives, see Roles and\nDirectives in the Sphinx documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"doc-style/docstrings.html#numpydoc-docstrings","title":"Numpydoc docstrings","text":"Numpydoc docstrings\n\nWhen writing docstrings for PyAnsys libraries, follow the syntax and best practices\ndescribed in Style guide in the numpydoc Manual.\n\nFor consistency within PyAnsys libraries, always use \"\"\" to introduce and conclude a\ndocstring, keeping the line length shorter than 70 characters.

It also\nreduces the number of dependencies that need to be installed, which can speed up the\ninstallation process and reduce the risk of dependency conflicts.\n\nHowever, it also implies that maintainers must be careful to ensure that the\noptional dependencies are properly documented and that the code that relies on them is\nprotected against missing dependencies.\n\nFor example, if a user tries to use a feature that requires an optional\ndependency that is not installed, the code should raise a clear error message saying\nthat the feature requires the optional dependency. This can be done using a try/except\nblock or a decorator, as shown in the previous section.\n\nA migration example of a library from not having a graphics target to having it\nis shown below:\n\nPyAnsys Geometry - 1782 - feat: separate graphics target\n\nPyMAPDL - 3820 - fix: Optional graphics dependency\n\nPyMAPDL Reader - 567 - feat: separate graphics target\n\nExamples of PyAnsys projects that have these optional dependencies are:\n\nPyPrimeMesh targets\n\nPyAnsys Geometry targets\n\nPyACP targets"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"how-to/packaging.html#dependency-version-range","title":"Packaging > Dependency version range","text":"Dependency version range\n\nThis guidance applies only to PyAnsys library projects. For projects\nwhich deliver an application or dedicated workflow, it is\nrecommended to fully pinning all (direct and transitive) dependencies.\n\nWhen specifying dependencies in a project, it is generally recommended to avoid\nsetting upper version limits unless it is absolutely necessary. The reason for\nthat is because arbitrarily restricting a dependency to be lower than a\ncertain version (for example numpy<2.0) can prevent your project from working\nwith newer and perfectly compatible versions, and often causes more problems\nthan it solves. Such restrictions limit forward compatibility, block users from\nupgrading dependencies, and increase the risk of version conflicts.\n\nThis issue is even more critical in the context of the PyAnsys metapackage\nwhich install many PyAnsys projects. In this setup, having strict upper bounds\non versions can easily result in unsatisfiable dependency constraints across\nthe ecosystem. For instance, if a package declares a dependency on numpy<2.0\ndespite being compatible with later versions, and another package requires\nnumpy>=2.0.0 to leverage a new feature, it becomes impossible to install\nboth packages simultaneously. This occurs even though no actual incompatibility\nexists between them, and it can lead to frustration for users and maintainers\nas it prevents otherwise compatible packages from being used together seamlessly.\n\nIt is better to define only a minimum version (>=) and rely on Continuous\nIntegration (CI) to detect real breakages as dependencies evolve. If a future\nversion does introduce a breaking change, you can then add an upper bound with\na clear explanation. For example:\n\nSetting a lower bound (>=) is considered good practice for multiple reasons.\nFirst, it documents the oldest version of a dependency that your project\nexplicitly supports. It is often the oldest version that is compatible with\nthe Python versions you support. For example, if your project supports\nPython versions from 3.11 to 3.13, you need to ensure that all dependencies\nare compatible with at least Python 3.11. This is important for users who may\nbe using older versions of Python and want to ensure compatibility with your\nproject. In other cases, the lower bound is related to the version where\ncertain key features your code relies on were first introduced. For instance,\nif your code uses an API or behavior that only appeared in version 1.3,\nsetting >=1.3 communicates both a technical requirement and an implicit\ncontract to your users and contributors.\n\nThis helps avoiding unexpected breakages when someone installs your project\nin an environment with older versions of dependencies. Rather than encountering\nobscure runtime errors or missing features, the version constraint prevents\nyour project to be installed. It also helps to maintain clarity for long-term\nmaintenance and simplifies debugging.\n\nBelow is an example of a dependency specification that follows these guidelines:\n\nflit\n\n\n\npoetry\n\n\n\nsetuptools\n\n"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"how-to/packaging.html#dependabot","title":"Packaging > Dependabot","text":"Dependabot\n\nDependabot is a built-in tool for keeping project dependencies updated.

If you close\nthis app, you can open it again at any time from the Windows Start menu by\nselecting Ansys Python Manager.\n\nOn the Install Python tab, install a selected Python version:\n\nFor Installation type, choose Standard to install the standard\ninstallation from the Python organization.\n\nFor Python version, choose Python 3.11 to install the latest available\nversion.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click Install.\n\nA Setup Progress window opens while Python is being installed and\nthen closes when the installation finishes.\n\nOn the Create virtual environments tab, create and activate a virtual environment:\n\nFor Select Python version, choose the Python version that you want to\ncreate a virtual environment for.\n\nYou likely have only the one Python version that you just installed.\nHowever, developers might have several Python versions installed.\n\nA virtual environment makes your life easier because you do not have\nto worry about dependency conflicts in the same environment. For more information,\nsee Creation of virtual environments in the\nPython documentation.\n\nFor Virtual environment name, type the name to give your virtual environment.\n\nFor example, type my_venv.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click Create.\n\nAfter a few seconds, an Information window opens, indicating that your\nvirtual environment has been successfully created.

You can copy the package information from here in the Administrator\nwindow and paste it into the issue template.\n\nIf a new release of an installed package is available, in addition to listing the installed\npackages, the Administrator window displays notices, which include the command for updating\nto the new release. Thus, you should periodically click List installed packages to see if\nyou need to update an installed package.\n\nAfter copying the update command for a package, you can paste it in the command prompt,\nwhich is the final line in the window that shows the name of your virtual environment in\nparentheses.

While you can choose\nto install a metapackage for a particular Ansys version, if you are contributing\nto PyAnsys documentation for only one package, or only for a few packages, choosing\nto install only these individual packages saves disk space.\n\nOnce the package is installed, this window closes.\n\nFrom the app’s File menu, periodically select Check for Updates to check for and install\nany updates available for the Ansys Python Manager.\n\nFrom the app’s Help menu, select Online Documentation to see this app’s documentation.\nIf this app is not open, you can go directly to the latest stable version of the\nAnsys Python Manager documentation on GitHub.\n\nFrom the app’s Help menu, select PyAnsys Documentation to open the PyAnsys Documentation\nwindow, where you can choose the documentation that you want to view.

Also add unit tests to the\ntests directory, following the pytest convention. Be sure to maintain\nsufficient coverage when adding to your library. See the pytest-cov documentation.\n\nIf your tests require an active service, app, or product,\nbe sure to set it up to run in an automated manner.\n\nUpdate documentation: The documentation source and content\nvary from repository to repository.

As\nan illustrative example, the deprecation of PyAdditive Widgets\nis used in this guide.\n\nInform the PyAnsys Core team: Before proceeding with the deprecation, it is essential to\ninform the PyAnsys Core team. This can be done by sending an email to\nthe team at pyansys.core@ansys.com. This step ensures that the\ndeprecation is communicated effectively and that the team can assist with any necessary\nchanges in the PyAnsys ecosystem.\n\nClose all open issues and pull requests: Before deprecating the library, ensure that all\nopen issues and pull requests in the library’s repository are closed. This helps to avoid\nconfusion and ensures that users are aware that the library is no longer actively maintained.\nYou can close issues and pull requests with a comment explaining that the library is being\ndeprecated and is no longer be supported.\n\nCreate a deprecation issue: Open an issue in the library’s repository to announce the\ndeprecation. This issue should explain why the library is being deprecated, what alternatives\nare available, and any relevant timelines. See a template below for the issue content.\n\nMake sure to adapt the template to your specific library and situation.\n\nThis issue serves as a permanent record of the deprecation and provide users with\nnecessary information about alternatives.\n\nMake sure to pin the issue to the top of the repository so that it is easily visible to users.\nThis can be done by selecting the “Pin issue” option in the issue’s right-side menu, on GitHub.\n\nSee an example at PyAdditive Widgets deprecation issue.\n\nAdapt the README: Update the library’s README file to reflect the deprecation.\nThis should include a clear notice at the top of the README, informing users that the\nlibrary is deprecated. See an example at PyAdditive Widgets README.\n\n(Optional) Add a warning in the code: If applicable, add a warning in the code itself to inform users\nthat the library is deprecated. This can be done using Python’s warnings module. For example:\n\nMake sure to adapt the URL in the warning message.\n\nSee an example at PyAdditive Widgets deprecation warning.\n\n(Optional) Adapt the documentation: PyAnsys libraries host documentation in GitHub Pages through\nthe gh-pages branch. If your library has documentation, consider adding a deprecation notice\nto the documentation as well. A similar note to the one in the README can be added at the landing\npage of the documentation. If you main landing page is an .rst file, you can add the\ndeprecation notice as a note directive:\n\n(Optional) Make a last release: If you carried out steps 5 and 6, consider making a final release\nof the library that includes the deprecation warning. This ensures that users who install\nthe library in the future see the warning immediately.\n\nArchive the repository: Once the deprecation issue is created and the README is updated,\nyou can archive the repository. This prevents any further changes to the repository and\nsignals to users that the library is no longer maintained. To archive a repository, go to the\nrepository settings and select “Archive this repository.”\n\nThese steps ensure that the deprecation process is clear and transparent, allowing users to\ntransition smoothly to alternatives while maintaining the integrity of the PyAnsys ecosystem.\n\nThe deprecation process may vary slightly depending on the specific library and its\ncontext.
