Abstractions
============

Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation
of an app from the user and emphasizing only usage.

One of the main objectives of PyAnsys libraries is to wrap (encapsulate) 
data and methods within units of execution while hiding data or parameters 
in protected variables.

The topics in this section demonstrate how apps and complex services
expose functionalities that matter to users and hide all else, such as conditional
statements and algorithms. For example, background details, implementation,
and states can all be hidden.
