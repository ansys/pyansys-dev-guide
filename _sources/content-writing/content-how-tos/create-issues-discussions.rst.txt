Create issues and discussions
=============================

Content contributors can be active participants in enhancing and adding to PyAnsys libraries.
In addition to reviewing and creating PRs, you can create issues and discussions
on the **Issues** page and **Discussions** page of a GitHub repository.

- Issues report, track, and manage bugs, feature requests, and other project-related
  tasks. Issues help to organize development efforts and prioritize work. Once an
  issue is created, you and others can leave comments to provide additional information,
  solutions, and progress updates.

- Discussions foster communication and interaction among community members, contributors,
  and project maintainers. Discussions help to centralize  conversations on particular topics,
  such as general usage questions or product announcements. You can also use discussions to
  facilitate brainstorming, planning, and the gathering of feedback.

Create an issue
---------------

To report an issue, request a new feature, or ask for project-specific troubleshooting assistance,
create an issue in the project's repository:

#. Go to the project repository.
#. Click the **Issues** tab to go to the **Issues** page.
#. In the upper right corner, click **New Issue**.
#. If the page that opens lists templates, click **Get Started** for the
   appropriate template.

   In most repositories, these issue templates are available:

   - **Bug, problem, error**: For filing a bug report
   - **Documentation issue**: For requesting modifications to the documentation
   - **Adding an example for Python project**: For proposing a new example for a client library
   - **New feature**: For requesting enhancements to the code

   If your issue does not fit one of these templates, you can click the **Open a blank issue**
   link.

#. Complete the form that is shown, providing a clear and detailed description of the issue. Include
   any relevant error messages, code snippets, and screenshots.
#. Click **Submit new issue**.

If you have general questions about the PyAnsy ecosystem, contact the
`PyAnsy core team <pyansys_core_email_>`_.

Create a discussion
-------------------
To post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback, create a discussion in
the project's repository:

#. Go to the project repository.
#. Click the **Discussions** tab to go to the **Discussions** page.

   .. note::
      In some repositories, the **Discussions** page is not available because the
      project maintainers want you to always use the `Discussions <https://discuss.ansys.com/>`_
      page on the Ansys Developer portal instead.

#. In the upper right corner, click **New discussion**.
#. If the page that opens lists templates, click **Get Started** for the
   appropriate template.

   In most repositories, these discussion templates are available:

   - **Announcements**: For filing a bug report
   - **General**: For chatting about anything and everything
   - **Ideas**: For sharing ideas for new features
   - **Polls**: For taking a vote from the community
   - **Q&A**: For asking the community for help
   - **Show and tell**: For showing off something that you've made

#. Complete the form, providing a clear and detailed title and description.
#. Click **Start discussion**.
