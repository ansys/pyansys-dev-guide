Content how-tos
===============

This section describes how to perform tasks related to contributing
to PyAnsys documentation. As indicated in earlier sections, PRs suggest
changes to the main codebase. Each PR undergoes a thorough review before
it can be approved and subsequently merged into the codebase.

Content contributors typically contribute to the codebase for a PyAnsys
library in one of two ways:

- By reviewing PRs created by fellow contributors
- By creating PRs that add to or improve the documentation

Additionally, content contributors can create issues on the **Issues**
page of a library's GitHub repository. If the repository has a **Discussions**
page, they can use it to start a discussion on this library. Otherwise, you
can post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback on the
`Discussions <https://discuss.ansys.com/>`_ on the Ansys Developer portal.
