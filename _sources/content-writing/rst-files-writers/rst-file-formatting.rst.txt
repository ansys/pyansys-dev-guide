RST file formatting
===================

The easiest and best way to understand how to format a RST file is to use the **Show Source**
link in the right navigation pane of a PyAnsys documentation page. Clicking this link
displays a text (TXT) version of the page's source file, where you can see the formatting.
To reuse any content, copy it from the TXT version and paste it directly into one of your RST files,
modifying it as necessary.

.. caution::
    You do not want to copy content from the TXT version of an API documentation page
    because this content is not manually authored in a RST file but rather automatically
    generated from a PY file.

To view the TXT version for this documentation page, click the **Show Source** link.
When you finish viewing the TXT version, click your browser's back arrow to return to
the documentation page.

If you want to view the TXT version of a richly formatted page in the PyFluent documentation,
read through and then perform these steps:

#. Go to the `Frequently asked questions <Fluent_faq_page_>`_ page in the PyFluent documentation.
#. In the right navigation pane, click the **Show Source** link to open the TXT version.
#. View the formatting for this page.
#. When finished, click your browser's back arrow to return to the PyFluent documentation page.
#. Click your browser's back arrow once again to return to the developer guide's documentation page.
